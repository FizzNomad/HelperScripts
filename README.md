# HelperScripts
Just little scripts and functions to make my life better.

Covid did a number on my brain so in here you will find little things i've come up with to help me out.

##### create_systemd_timer.sh
This little script automates the steps to create a systemd timer and service.
It was a good exercise as it started fairly simple, and then I thought about the user being able to select the name of the service,or to update an existing timer. It had no error handling so that was included along with some user friendly output.
